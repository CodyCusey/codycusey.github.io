# PostgreSQL Database Work

Database design, creation, scripting, modification, queries, and ERD in PostgreSQL with PGAdmin 4.

Challenge: Design, create, and query a relational database using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin 4.

Context: The world is becoming more and more data driven every second. The need for functioning databases is essential for most entities to exist anymore. The ability to design, develope, maintain, script, and query data from a database is a crucial skill for any technology professional to be successful. 

Action: This project includes all the necessary scripts to create the database, tables, fields, datatypes, primary and foreign key constraints. It also includes all of the required .csv files and script to import all of the data. The database project ERD is included as visual reference for anyone trying to query data from this configuration. All of the queries performed are included in the script files as well and must be commented out in order to run after database creation.

Result: I successfully completed my database implementation within the required deadline. I learned how to script a full database creation, including variable datatypes, importing .csv data from files, and primary and foreign key constraints. I was able to leverage the relational database design to perform complex queries through careful join commands. The use of mathematical operations such as SUM, COUNT, or AVERAGE allows large sets of queried data to be preseted in a summarized fashion.

Reflection: I was tasked with creating this database for a database class. This was the end of our relational database studies and was the culmination of all my works. I was proud to have this project scripted out and functioning without fail. Through the design process, I became increasingly familiar with JOINS on relational databases and had a lot of fun creating complex queries to return values from far reaches into the database table heirarchy.
