    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The backend database is built on .json</p>
    <p>Vue allows a dynamic single page web framework to be interacted with.<br>
      The routing is all handled through a router sevice to allow communications between vues.<br>
      There is a dynamic and calculable styling called scss which allows variable definition and math to be done for stylistic properties.
      The overall setup/framework is a bit more confusing out of the box, with a lot more moving parts.
      Once you understand the flow of information throught the structure, it becomes more intuitive and coder friendly.
