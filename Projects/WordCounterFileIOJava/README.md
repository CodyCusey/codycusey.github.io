# Unique Word Counter

My Unique Word Counting Application that I developed in Java.

Challenge: Design a Java Console Application that would allow a user to return a list and count of unique words used in a selected reading.

Context: The idea for this application was to provide a way to quickly identify each of the unique words used in a reading, as well as have a count for how many times each word was used. Users select a file to be read in, the app  will count and store the unique words and have the results output. By implementing a TreeMap storage heirarchy, the data is quickly and efficiently read in, enumerated, and presented back to the end user.

Action: Using Eclipse IDE, I created a console-based Java Unique Word Counting application. Upon running, the user is prompted asking to input a number in which corresponds to one of the preselected readings. This selection initiates the local file read-in for the file they wish to analyze. Immediately following the selection, the output stream will appear in the console window. Through the use of an extremely efficient collection system, the TreeMap, this application is able to perform all of its' work in less than 0.5 seconds (on most systems and platforms). By scrolling through the results, the user can determine what are the least and most used words in any given reading.

Result: I successfully completed my application within deadline criteria and learned how to use Java and how to read in information from files. By utilizing concepts such as Maps, Sets, File I/O, and functions to quickly read in and store data, the user gets results within milliseconds after selection is made. I learned how to implement efficient code by utilzing functions to do work, classes to build objects, and Maps to store the objects and data. I also learned how to utilize other programmatic logic such as if / else statements and try / catch /finally logic.

Reflection: I was interested in a tool that would read in files and allow me to get a list and count of unique words in a quick and efficient manner. By using Java and File I/O, I was able to create the exact application that I needed.
