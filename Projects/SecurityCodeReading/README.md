# Code Reading and Vulnerability Analysis

Challenge: Perform a vulnerability analysis on a functioning application, report on findings and provide solutions.

Context: Code reading is an essential tool for any technology professional. Having the ability to quickly understand and interpret code gives you a competitive advantage when it comes to preventing cyber criminal attacks. Whether it's in your workplace, on a project, or just in your every day life, online security and security awareness must remain on the forefront of the users mind. 

Action: By having access to source code, like in these examples, I was able to spot potential vulnerabilities within the application. Some of these would be easily exploited, where others would take a more advanced penetration technique. Using JetBrains' IntelliJ IDE, I was able to thoroughly examine every aspect of this application's code. Upon inspection, I had discovered several potential vulnerabilities such as improper input validation, improper variable typing, unnecessary user input fields, clear text password storage and more. Through thoughtful considerations, I provided security measure to implement in order to improve overall application security. 

Result: I successfully completed my code review and vulnerability analysis. I was able to determine many potential vulnerability concerns within the existing application code and provide appropriate actions to help improve overall application security through simple code fixes. This was a really fun and useful exercise that felt it had a ton of real world application. The ability to dig into an application, website, or database, understand what is happening, how it should or shouldn't be happening, and be able to fix, update, or maintain is an absolutely essential skill for the emerging technology professional's toolkit.

Reflection: I was interested in testing my own code reading skills and overall knowledge of applications and application security. By spending time analyzing each section of code, I was able to confidently identify security threats and provide reccomendations to fix.
