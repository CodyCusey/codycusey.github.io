# ACC BCC Expansion Project

My hypothetical Project Management Project Plan for BCC Expansion at American Chemet Corporation.

Challenge: Create a complete project plan for a hypothetical production expansion at American Chemet Corporation.

Context: For the final project in my Project Management class, I had to prepare a complete project plan for a real or fictional scenario. Using the concepts learned I was able to produce documents that include: stakeholder management, resource gathering, resource planning, risk management, quality and communications planning, as well as several others, this project includes all of the documents covering these topics.

Action: In this quasi-fictional project scenario, I am the project manager for this project and along with the many other made-up team members, I created a communication plan and team charter to show roles and responsibilites along with work needing to be accomplished in a Project Schedule and Work Breakdown Structure. Through thoughtful ROI calculations, quality assurance, and outstanding communication, American Chemet Corporation has agreed to invest in a production expansion for the BCC product line. Risk management, expert procurement methods, exceptional negotiation skills, and redundancy in supply chain allows this project to be a succss and hit payback periods soon than expected.

Result: I successfully completed my application within deadline criteria and learned how to use many valuable tools and templates. The use of these tools provides quick and easy ways to perform repeatable calculations at different phases in a project. Additionally, the use of templates provides standardized wording and consistancy of presentation, making the extremely complex world of project management a breeze. Even though this project has fictional elements, the results lead the reader to believe this was a legit project.

Reflection: I had no idea what "Project Management" was until I started in this course. Preparing all of the required documents, performing estimations, and building out project plans meant little to nothing from a buisness perspective, but now I feel confident conversing about project related requirements.
