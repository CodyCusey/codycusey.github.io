# Commission Calculator

My Commission Calculator Console Application that I developed in C#.

Challenge: Design a C# Console Application that would allow a user to determine commissioned amounts based on differing criteria.

Context: For people who work in the world of sales, often a sizeable portion of their income is earned through bonuses and commissions. With a commission calculator app,
users can enter in different sales scenarios, based on different criteria, and be given the calculated payment estimations. With additional features such as calculated bonus and hours worked input fields, the user can run multiple scenarios to be sure of the best way to utilize their resources during a given pay period.

Action: Using Microsoft Visual Studio, I created a console-based C# commission calculating application. Upon running, the user is prompted asking to input number of sales persons
(or scenarios) they wish to analyze. They are followed with prompts asking for input of "Name", "Commission Level", "Hours Worked", and "Sales Amount". The user will include all of
the requested inputs for each of the sales people originally selected. The program stores all of the data, performs the proper calculations, and outputs each of the selection scenarios, including a "Totals" output, which can be used to analyze a workforce, team, or department in a similar fashion.

Result: I successfully completed my application within deadline criteria and learned how to use C# and the Object Oriented Program (OOP) logic. By utilizing concepts such as classes, dictionaries, and fucntions to create and store multiple obejcts, the user can analyze multiple scenarios and be returned results utilizing each iteration. I learned how to implement efficient code by utilzing functions to do work, classes to build objects, and dictionaries to store the objects and data. I also learned how to utilize other programmatic logic such as if / else statements, switch / break statements, and try / catch logic.

Reflection: I was interested in a tool that would allow me to run multiple scenarios of similar data in a quick and efficient manner. By using C# and the OOP methodolgy, I was able to create the exact application that I needed.
