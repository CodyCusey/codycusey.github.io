# Flutter Pricing Application

My Flutter based Single Page Pricing Application made for American Chemet Corporation.

Challenge: Design a single code based application to validate pricing requests for purchases by American Chemet Corporation.

Context: Purchasing policies at American Chemet Corporation state that pricing is at the sellers option. What this means for the Purchasing Department, is that suppliers can place requests for pricing virtually whenever. It is our obligation to fulfill these pricing requests as soon as possible. The shortcomings in the system is that these requests cannot be validated unless on a computer. The pricing app fixes that!

Action: The user can select from various different deployment platforms, including but not limited to: IOS mobile devices and tablets, Android mobile devices and tablets, Windows based Application, Mac OS Application, and Web Application. Upon launching, the user is greeted with a welcome screen requesting the user to input information to be validated. 

Result: I successfully completed my code review and vulnerability analysis. I was able to determine many potential vulnerability concerns within the existing application code and provide appropriate actions to help improve overall application security through simple code fixes. This was a really fun and useful exercise that felt it had a ton of real world application. The ability to dig into an application, website, or database, understand what is happening, how it should or shouldn't be happening, and be able to fix, update, or maintain is an absolutely essential skill for the emerging technology professional's toolkit.

Reflection: I was interested in testing my own code reading skills and overall knowledge of applications and application security. By spending time analyzing each section of code, I was able to confidently identify security threats and provide reccomendations to fix.
